    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                 meaty tomato sauce
            </li>
             <li>
                 noodles  
             </li>
             <li>
           cheese into a casserole. 
             </li>
        </ul>
    
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>

            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready</strong>. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>

            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
