    <p>Recipe:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into ¼-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.


        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is aldente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.


        </li>

        <li>
            When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add ½ cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.

    </ol>
